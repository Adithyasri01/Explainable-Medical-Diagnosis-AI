# Explainable AI for Medical Diagnosis Using Big Data

## Overview
This project builds an explainable AI system for cancer diagnosis using medical imaging data. It applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification and integrates techniques like Grad-CAM, SHAP, and LIME to make model predictions transparent and trustworthy for healthcare professionals.

## Objectives
- Classify X-ray or MRI images for disease detection (e.g., cancer).
- Use visual explanation techniques to interpret model predictions.
- Provide reports understandable by clinicians and researchers.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**, **TensorFlow/Keras**, **PyTorch**
- **Grad-CAM**, **SHAP**, **LIME**
- **OpenCV**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**
- Optionally scalable using **Apache Spark** for big data

## Notebooks
- `model_training.ipynb`: Train CNN models
- `explainability_analysis.ipynb`: Generate explanations using Grad-CAM & SHAP
